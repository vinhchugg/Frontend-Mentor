### What I learned

All of these challenges have a section that is tricky and require some form research to figure out. I've learnt how to research these issues whilst also staying determined. From doing so, I was able to better understand how to utilise 

### Continued development

Though these challenges have made me an overall better Frontend developer, I know that there are still lots of areas where I am lacking such as positioning an image or using the correct html semantic tag. I hope to keep practicing and learning so that I can get a better grasp of this. I will be doing this by further self-teaching using online resources and the challenges on Codewell.
